# MP3-Converter-Python-1
It is a MP3 Converter, read READ ME to get a clearer understanding of how to use the exe file.

the .exe file (or Application, depending on which explorer view you are using) needs to be put in a designated folder, as that is where all audios are gonna be downloaded to.
This is the first version of the converter except it to be a bit buggy, any problems report them back to me

Yours Sincerely,
Grizzly
